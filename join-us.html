<p>Here’s something that all Rotary club members have in common: We take action. As community volunteers, we reach out to neighbors in need. We build, support, and organize. We save lives. We work locally and globally.<br>
Around the world and around the corner, the 1.2 million men and women of Rotary</p>
<ul>
<li>Get involved in their communities.</li>
<li>Connect with other professionals.</li>
<li>Share their time and experience with young people.</li>
<li>Support global causes, such as eradicating polio.</li>
<li>Use their skills to help others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re a veteran volunteer or new to community service, we’re looking for people like you. Answer a few questions and we’ll help you get in touch with a club in your community.</p>
<h4>I want to join a Rotary club</h4>
<p>Rotary club members are men and women of all ages and professional backgrounds who use their talents, skills, and energy to improve the lives of people in communities at home and around the world.<br>
Each Rotary club has a unique membership process. Answer a few questions and we’ll help you get in touch with a club in your community.</p>

<p>Already a Rotarian but want to recommend someone for club membership? Answer a few questions and we’ll forward their information to the district in their area.</p>
<p>Note: If you want to recommend someone for membership in your own Rotary club, contact your club secretary or complete the How to Propose a New Member form.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;I’m looking for a new club</h4>
<p>Are you a current Rotary club member who’s moving? Or a current or former Rotarian looking for a new club in your area? Answer a few questions and we’ll help you connect with nearby Rotary clubs. Because of the autonomous structure of Rotary clubs, membership cannot be automatically transferred.<br>
Rotary e-clubs, which meet online, offer an alternative way to become involved in Rotary.</p>
